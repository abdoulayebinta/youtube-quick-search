# The app
Simple and quick youtube search app with React and Redux.
Fetch data from a remote API in this case Youtube API.
Therefore, making AJAX Request with React and Redux whenever a user search for a video on the app.

## React and Redux 

This project is based on a course I took on udemy on Modern React with Redux with Stepnen Grider (Engineering Architect). Stephen Grider has been building complex Javascript front ends for top corporations in the San Francisco Bay Area. With an innate ability to simplify complex topics, Stephen has been mentoring engineers beginning their careers in software development for years.

I build this small youtube application and customize it for personal purposes.


## Goals and intention

Mastering React and Redux can make a developer more in demand in the modern web development industry and it can also help me build that personal project I've been dreaming of. 

So, here I put the core knowledge I need to deeply understand and build React components and structure applications with Redux.

### What I get from it?
* I master the fundamentals of React, including JSX, "props", "state", and eventing
* I realize the power of building composable components
* I become fluent in the toolchain supporting React, including NPM, Webpack, Babel, and ES6/ES2015
* I master fundamental concepts behind structuring Redux applications
* I build amazing single page applications with React JS and Redux 
* I master Redux (reducers, actions, and the state tree)
* I dive deeper into Redux by using middleware

### Installation
```
> git clone https://github.com/abdoulayebinta/youtube-quick-search.git
> cd youtube-quick-search
> npm install
> npm start
```
Go to your localhost:  http://localhost:8080
and search for your video (just like if you were on youtube) but It's faster than youtube :-). By default, you will find my company videos.
